# TV Script Generation

Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree #3

In this project, I generated Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Dataset included part of the Seinfeld scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network produced a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

# Example of newly generated script:


jerry: the other yorker, the whole thing is...

kramer:(to jerry) oh, come on, i'm sorry, i don't think i may.

elaine: well, i just got a lot of thought, and i can't go to the duty..(elaine nods and walks away)

george:(still holding off his hand and starts walking towards the kitchen)

elaine:(looking at his shirt) yeah... well, i just wanted to say something.

elaine: what do you think,"?

jerry:" you got your own personal pods....

george:(still looking at the story) i know, i don't know. you know, the thing is.
